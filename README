Roshan Choxi's Dot Files 

Updated to use Oh-my-zsh
http://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.

Installation

  git clone git://github.com/choxi/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake install
  # edit ~/.gitconfig and personalize it
  
Environment

I am running on Mac OS X, but it will likely work on Linux as well with 
minor fiddling. I primarily use zsh, but this includes some older bash 
files as well. If you would like to switch to zsh, you can do so with 
the following command.

  chsh -s /bin/zsh


Features

I normally place all of my coding projects in ~/code, so this directory 
can easily be accessed (and tab completed) with the "c" command.

  c railsca<tab>

There is also an "h" command which behaves similar, but acts on the 
home path.

  h doc<tab>
